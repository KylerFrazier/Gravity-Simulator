Project title: Gravity Simulator

Author: Kyler Frazier

Created in August 2019.

Python version 3.7.1 
File that executes the program: gs.py

Details: 
A gravity simulator that models non-relativistic (classical) gravity.
Currently, the screen starts with a Sun and Earth and many comets.
When a comet leaves the screen, it will be deleted and a new comet with random parameters will appear.

Future implementation: 
User inputs all the parameters of the body (mass, radius, velocity), click screen to add it, and it will make an accurate model 
of it with an appropriate color for the mass of the object (e.g. objects of roughly one solar mass 
will be yellow and objects that are small and heavy will be turned into blackholes).
